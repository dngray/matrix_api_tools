# Matrix API tools

These scripts are just reminders of how to use the
[admin_api](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/admin_api/)
requests and some [client](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/latest)
based requests.

Only requirement is on [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq) to parse
JSON data.
